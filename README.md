# Vigenere
Implementation of the cryptographic algorithm Vigenere

## Background
The Vigenère cipher, was invented by a Frenchman, Blaise de Vigenère in the 16th century. It is a polyalphabetic cipher because it uses two or more cipher alphabets to encrypt the data. In other words, the letters in the Vigenère cipher are shifted by different amounts, normally done using a word or phrase as the encryption key.
